# Recommendation Preferences for hotel booking platforms

## Description
In this project, I scraped data from 3 websites which are booking.com, expedia.com and hotels.com.

This project is about exploratory analyze the data of hotel information of a specific stay period and a specific location and let users can interact with the data.

Furthermore, I will try to find out each website’s Recommendation Preferences, such as which website used to recommend more expensive hotels or which website recommend higher review score hotel first.
So, When scraping the data, I did not filter the hotels, such as by price ascending or by hotel stars, which means it is all the default recommendations of each website. It gives me a 
chance to explore the recommendations preferences.

## To accomplish this goal, I did the following steps:

• Data Scraping

• Data Processing

• Exploratory data analysis (Visualization)

• Interaction with the user


## 
It is worth mentioning that The specific stay period and a specific location I chose are from 2022.12.23 to 2022.12.25 in Venice, Italy.
