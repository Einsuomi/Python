# Marvel Comics Characters Relationship Network

## Project Description

In this project, I will work with the data related to the characters in Marvel Comics. 

The dataset contains the link between characters, i.e., heroes and villains of the Marvel universe. 

My goal is to perform network analysis to identify the most central characters based on the provided network structure.


## Solutions


- Calculate different centrality measures for the network (degree centrality, betweenness, closeness, PageRank).

- Compare the results. 

- Calculate the number of common characters of the top 10 characters for each pair of methods. 

- Calculate the correlations between the measures. (Try to understand which methods are the most similar to each other in terms of the most central characters and in terms of correlation?)
