## Project Description 

I will build a predictive model to estimate selling price for houses.


## Solutions

I will perform the following tasks:

- Exploratory data analysis: try to understand the different variables in the data. Identify the variables that you think have an effect on the price of the house based on exploratory data analysis methods.
 
- Develop a decision tree regression model that the company can use to predict the selling price for new houses on the market. Try to optimize the parameters to get the best MSE.
