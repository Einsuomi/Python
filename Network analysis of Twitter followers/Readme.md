# Network Analysis of Twitter Followers

In our age of extremely developed social media, the analysis of social media followers is essential. Through the analysis, we can be clearer about the composition and distribution of our followers, which can highly benefit the goal of operating our social media, and at the meantime, the network analysis can help us be more targeted in attracting followers in the future.
