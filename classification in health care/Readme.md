# Classification in Health Care

## Dataset Description 

The dataset contains some measurements about patients, who experienced angina, which can typically be a symptom of coronary artery disease.

- age: age of the patient
- gender: gender of the patient (0 - female, 1 - male)
- pain: intensity of the chest pain (integer value, 0-3)
- blood pressure: blood pressure of the patient
- cholesterol: cholesterol in blood, mg/dl
- blood sugar: indicating whether the blood sugar level is normal or not (1 when it is above 120 mg/dl, and 0 otherwise)
- heart rate: maximum heart rate
- exercise: whether the chest pain was induced by some physical exercise or not (1 or 0)
- outcome: 1 for patients with heart attack, and 0 for patients who did not have heart attack

## Project Description 

Try to find the best accuracy model to predict the "outcome". 

## Solutions

- Try to understand the different variables using some statistical measures and some visualization tools.

- Make the prediction of "outcome" column with 4 classification models.

- Optimize the models for the parameters and try to find the model with best accuracy. 

- Identify the four most important predictors according to the best decision tree model. 

- Create a new decision tree model that uses only those four variables as predictors, and try to make better accuracy.
