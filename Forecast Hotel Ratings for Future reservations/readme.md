# Introduction

  This project deals with a real world problem in the big data era and presents a new perspective on how hotels can maintain and improve their online reputation through the use of machine learning techniques to predict the ratings of reservations. The approach involves analysing data that customers provide when booking a room. 

  The project's primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting negative instances, a critical factor in managing online reputation. 4 algorithms are used and total 124 models are created to accomplish this goal. 

  This project include all steps of data analysis to handle a real world problem, from idea generation, background research, data collection, data preprocessing, EDA, feature engieering, data modeling and analysis, results interpretation.

# Algorithms
- Logistic regression
- Random forest
- XGBoost
- ANN

# Variables 
- Country: Where the customers come from of a reservation
- Room_type: Which room type the customers book in a reservation
- Nights: How many nights customers book in a researvation
- Check_in_Month : In which month will the customers check in of a researvation
- Travel_Type: The customers travel as a Group, Family, Couple, or Solo.
- Rating: The target variable, How would the customers rate their stay.
